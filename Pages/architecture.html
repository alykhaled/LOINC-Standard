            <h2>Software Architecture</h2>
            <p>The LOINC standard is implemented using a distributed, service-oriented software architecture that supports scalability, reliability, and interoperability. The software architecture is designed to be flexible and extensible, allowing new features and functionality to be added as needed to meet changing requirements.</p>
            
            <h4>Service-Oriented Architecture</h4>
            <p>The LOINC standard is based on a service-oriented architecture, which means that it is composed of a set of independent, loosely-coupled services that work together to provide the overall functionality of the system. The services are designed to be modular and interchangeable, so that they can be easily replaced or upgraded without affecting the rest of the system.</p>
            
            <h4>Microservices</h4>
            <p>The LOINC standard uses a microservices architecture, which means that the system is divided into small, independently-deployable services that can be scaled and managed separately. Each microservice is responsible for a specific set of functionality, such as data ingestion, normalization, or mapping. This allows for greater flexibility and agility in development and deployment.</p>
            
            <h4>APIs</h4>
            <p>The LOINC standard uses a set of RESTful APIs to expose the functionality of the system to other applications and systems. The APIs are designed to be easy to use and integrate, and provide a standardized interface for accessing LOINC codes and terminology. The APIs also support a wide range of data formats and protocols, allowing for interoperability with other healthcare systems and applications.</p>
            
            <p>Overall, the software architecture of the LOINC standard is designed to be modular, scalable, and flexible, allowing for easy integration with other healthcare systems and applications. The use of a service-oriented architecture, microservices, and APIs helps to ensure that the system is reliable, efficient, and easy to use.</p>
