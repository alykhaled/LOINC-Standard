            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>The Logical Observation Identifiers Names and Codes (LOINC) standard is a universal code system for identifying medical laboratory and clinical observations. It was created in 1994 by Regenstrief Institute, a non-profit medical research organization located in Indianapolis, Indiana, in collaboration with the laboratory community. The goal of LOINC is to standardize the way clinical observations are identified, recorded, and shared across different healthcare systems, institutions, and regions.</p>
            <p>Today, LOINC is widely used around the world by hospitals, clinics, laboratories, public health agencies, and health information technology vendors to exchange information about laboratory tests, clinical measurements, and other observations. LOINC includes over 95,000 unique codes for measurements, tests, and assessments in many different domains such as hematology, microbiology, cardiology, radiology, and many others.</p>
            <p>LOINC codes are used to facilitate interoperability and data exchange in healthcare by ensuring that different healthcare information systems use the same codes to represent the same clinical observations. This helps to improve patient care, reduce medical errors, and support clinical research and quality improvement initiatives. LOINC is continually updated and maintained by a team of experts to ensure that it remains current and relevant to the evolving needs of the healthcare community.</p>
